# DevOps EPAM Project

This project contains three main tasks related to DevOps and Python.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Dictionary Class

In this task, a `Dictionary` class is created that allows adding words and their definitions, as well as searching for word definitions.
The Dictionary class allows adding new word entries with their definitions and searching for word definitions. If the word is not found, it returns a message indicating that the entry was not found.

### Task 2: Calculate Total Cost

In this task, a function is developed to calculate the total cost of purchased items, including a given tax. The function takes a dictionary of items and their costs, a list of purchased items, and a tax rate.
The function sums the cost of the purchased items that are in the cost dictionary and then applies the tax rate to the total. The result is rounded to two decimal places.

### Task 3: Concatenate n-th Letters

In this task, a function is developed that takes a list of words and concatenates the n-th letter of each word to build a new word. The n-th letter is determined by the position of the word in the list.
The function iterates through each word in the list and concatenates the n-th letter of each word (where n is the position of the word in the list) to build a new word.
